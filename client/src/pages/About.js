              Hello! I'm Priya Vasudevan, and this blog is a personal project
              where I share my thoughts and ideas on web development. As a
              passionate developer, I aim to create a welcoming space for
              beginners eager to learn the essentials of web development. Here,
              you'll find a wide range of resources designed to help you get
              started and understand what to study to build a solid foundation
              in web development.
